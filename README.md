# Computational Human Genomics

As a component of the Computational Human Genomics course instructed by Dr. Yari Ciani and Prof. Francesca Demichelis for the academic year 2022-2023, this project focuses on implementing a human genomic workflow for a patient. The objective is to analyze both tumor and control samples, employing the workflow to identify germline and somatic variants, ascertain the patient's ancestry, and investigate tumor ploidy and purity.
